"""The leaf API-plugin contract: what an approved leaf DECLARES about its API.

A leaf app (FigRecipe, Writer, Scholar, ...) owns the behaviour of its own
endpoints. What it does not own is the SHAPE a client may rely on: the routes,
the request/response/error schemas, the auth scope, the idempotency promise,
the pagination style, the rate/quota class, the audit level, the API version
and the deprecation window. Those cross a package boundary — browser, agent,
and thin native clients all read them — so they are DECLARED here as data and
checked at construction, not discovered by reading an implementation.

WHY A DECLARATION RATHER THAN THE IMPLEMENTATION. The operator's model
(2026-09-16): the public SDK lets clients be built against approved APIs, while
server-side leaf endpoint plugins are a HIGHER-TRUST class requiring SciTeX
approval. A contract that must be approved is a contract that must be readable
without executing the leaf: everything below is plain data, importable and
comparable, and the handler is named as a string, never imported here.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. No Hub ORM, no middleware, no root-route
registration, no raw shell/path/argv, and no framework object: a route path is
a RELATIVE declaration that is validated (see :func:`_validate_path`) so it
cannot escape its mount, and the handler reference is an entry-point-style
``module:attr`` string. Nothing in this module serves a request — the host
composes routes; this layer says what may be composed.

FAIL CLOSED. Every rule below refuses at construction, because each one would
otherwise present as a working API: an undeclared auth scope opens an endpoint,
a mutating method with no idempotency declaration double-creates on retry, an
unstructured error leaves a client nothing to branch on, and a deprecation with
no sunset never arrives. Strictness is the feature; the alternative is a client
that ships against a promise nobody made.

ZERO THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES. scitex-app's base install is stdlib plus
click/rich/scitex-config, and this module must stay importable from the CLI, the
MCP surface and a test process alike. The descriptors are therefore frozen
stdlib dataclasses, NOT pydantic models: the declaration layer is data, and
validation of a live REQUEST is the serving host's job. Flagged as a decision
for the card's owner — see the note in :data:`DESCRIPTOR_IMPLEMENTATION`.

#: How the descriptors are implemented, stated where a reader will look. The
#: alternative (pydantic v2 models) would add a hard dependency to a package
#: whose base install is stdlib-only, so it is a published-install-surface
#: change and therefore the card owner's ruling rather than a silent choice.
DESCRIPTOR_IMPLEMENTATION = "stdlib-frozen-dataclasses"

#: The entry-point group a leaf publishes its API plugin under. Parallel to the
#: ``scitex.apps`` group in :mod:`scitex_sdk.app.plugins`: the value is read as a
#: STRING (nothing is imported until the host deliberately loads it), which is
#: what makes an installed package "trusted" rather than "arbitrary code".
API_ENTRY_POINT_GROUP = "scitex.apis"

#: HTTP methods a route may declare — the closed set the approval surface can
#: reason about. Anything else (a custom verb, a bare ``*``) is refused.
HTTP_METHODS = ("GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE")

#: Methods that CHANGE state. A route using one of these must declare its
#: idempotency behaviour: a retried POST with no declared key is the
#: double-create the operator called out.
MUTATING_METHODS = ("POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE")

#: How a route answers. ``sse`` and ``binary`` are first-class because leaves
#: genuinely have them (measured on FigRecipe: a streaming chat endpoint and
#: ``download/{fmt}``) — a contract that only models JSON would make those
#: endpoints undescribable, which is how they end up undocumented.

#: generated OpenAPI fragment needs no translation table.
FIELD_TYPES = ("string", "integer", "number", "boolean", "object", "array")

#: already fixed by :mod:`scitex_sdk.app._app_scope`; ``none`` means the response is
#: not scoped to an actor at all (a public listing).
PROJECT_SCOPES = ("none", "user", "project")

#: Default header a client sends its idempotency key in.
IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_HEADER = "Idempotency-Key"

#: Header names an idempotency key may NEVER be declared in, lowercased. An
#: idempotency key and an authentication credential (or a cookie, or a
#: framing/length field, or a hop-by-hop control) cannot share one header: the
#: message would have to carry two values with different meanings, and whichever
#: of the two the declaring client loses is a security or framing bug that the
#: declaration itself caused. Comparison is case-insensitive (HTTP field names
#: are), so ``Authorization`` and ``authorization`` are the same refusal.

#: The security scheme every scoped operation's requirement names, and the
#: component the fragment declares it as. The scheme is an OAuth2
#: ``authorizationCode`` flow when it is emitted, because that is what the
#: requirement's value IS: an array of OAuth scopes. A scheme that carries a
#: scope array but declares no flows and no scope map would be a document that
#: names scopes it never defines, so the plugin has to declare the authorization
#: server it trusts (see :class:`OAuthProvider`) for a scoped requirement to be
#: emittable at all.
OAUTH_SECURITY_SCHEME = "scitexOAuth"

#: RECOMMENDED rate/quota classes — examples for the approved deployments, NOT
#: a closed enum. The hub ruled (2026-09-17) that a leaf may declare its own

#: is not refused for naming a class this module has never heard of, and the
