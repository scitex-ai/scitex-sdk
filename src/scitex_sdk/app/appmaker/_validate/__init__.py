"""App validator — check structure, security, manifest, templates, and CSS.

Split from a single 537-line module. This file is the ORCHESTRATOR and the
import surface: every name the old module exposed is re-exported here, so
`from scitex_sdk.app.appmaker._validate import <anything>` keeps working. The checks
themselves live one concern per module:

    _app_layout    required files, and the manifest reads the others depend on
    _security      forbidden patterns in the app's own Python
    _manifest      manifest.json schema and content
    _frame         workspace frame rules for templates and CSS
    _dependencies  the manifest's `dependencies` shape
    _prefix        mount-prefix safety for request URLs

    """Run all validations, separating FAILURES from ADVICE.

    Returns `(errors, warnings)`. Errors fail a build; warnings are reported and
    change nothing.

    WHY THE TIER EXISTS. `validate()` returned one flat list and its only
    consumer does `raise SystemExit(1)` on any entry, so "should" and "must"
    were indistinguishable to the thing acting on them. Two findings were worded
    as advice and enforced as failures, and one of them was UNCLEARABLE: an app
    could not satisfy it without introducing the collision the rule's own
    remediation would cause. A rule nobody can clear does not raise quality — it
    teaches people to stop running the validator.

    NOT an argument for softening the other error-tier findings. Their wording
    matches their enforcement, including the forbidden `version` key, whose
    message cites the incident where every hub app tile showed a wrong version.

    THE `check_*` DEFAULT IS THE ARMING SWITCH — flipping one to True is the
    whole of "arm that rule". They are named keywords rather than one blanket
    flag so each stays greppable and individually revisitable; each rule's own
    docstring says whether it is armed, and if not, what has to be true first.

        check_prefix_safety   request URLs that break under a mount   ARMED
        check_js_safety       dangerous patterns in the app's JS      not armed
        check_bundle_size     total shipped size against a threshold  not armed
        check_privileges      shape of the privilege declaration      not armed
        check_css_canonical   the canonical workspace-CSS rule        not armed

    `check_css_canonical` is the ONE that supersedes rather than adds: it is
    the same spec `validate_css` enforces, measured properly. It is off, and it
    does not turn `validate_css` off, so today the two coexist and only the old
    one runs. That is deliberate and temporary — arming it means replacing the
    call above, not adding to it, and the replacement waits on scitex-hub
    re-measuring their five findings against THIS implementation. Whoever arms
    it must delete the `validate_css` call in the same change; leaving both
    would report one CSS defect twice under two wordings.

    This paragraph read "EVERY `check_*` KEYWORD IS OFF BY DEFAULT" until the
    day one was not. It is listed per-rule now because a sentence quantified
    over all of them goes false the first time any single one is armed, and a
    docstring that is false about the arming state of a GATE is worse than no
    docstring — the reader has no reason to doubt it.

    The last three were PORTED from `scitex_sdk.app.validator.AppValidator`, where
    they worked, were tested, were described to app developers by the shipped
    skill doc — and were called by nothing. The CLI read no `.js` file at all.
    Bringing them into the live path is additive: none of them has a counterpart
    here, so none can contradict a verdict this module already gives.
