# these six, so `license` was required by the CLI and not by AppValidator and

# and that promise had already been broken once here and once in the JS pattern
# list (0.16.2), both silently, both in the direction that disagrees about a
# peer's app.

# A TUPLE, not a list: this object is imported, so a list would be mutable
# shared state that any importer could `.append()` to, changing validation for
# every caller in the interpreter. (scitex-writer, 2026-09-06.)

    worded "should" and enforced as a failure, which is how it became
