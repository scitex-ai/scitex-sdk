"""Shared leaf-app version-display context processors.

Every SciTeX leaf app shows its OWN installed version, continuously (on every
page, not once in a footer) and never hardcoded. The version is read from
importlib.metadata via the shared ``package_version()`` in ``scitex_sdk.app._django``
(the single source of truth — see the 2026-07 incident where hand-written
manifest versions drifted from the shipped packages).

A host app registers the processor it needs in TEMPLATES OPTIONS
``context_processors``:

    "context_processors": [
        "scitex_sdk.app.context_processors.scitex_app_version",   # the SDK itself
        "scitex_sdk.app.context_processors.app_version",          # a mounted leaf app
    ]

``scitex_app_version`` adds ``scitex_app_version`` (the scitex-sdk app SDK's own
installed version). ``app_version`` reads the mounted app's ``ScitexAppConfig``
and adds ``app_version`` (the leaf's OWN package version, from its
``pip_package``). Both degrade to the labelled ``"0.0.0+local"`` fallback for
editable checkouts / a missing dist — they never raise and never emit a
hardcoded release number.
