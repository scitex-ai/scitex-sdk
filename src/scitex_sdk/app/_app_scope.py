"""The declarative leaf-app scope contract (operator ledger #48, #144-149).

A leaf app declares, in its manifest, whether it is USER-scoped or
PROJECT-scoped. That single declaration drives the ONE rule this contract
enforces: the global Hub header MUST NEVER force a Current-Project selector.

  - user-scoped   -> emits NO project-scope marker; the app renders with no
                     project switcher at all.
  - project-scoped-> emits a project-scope marker the per-app workspace
                     surface (NOT the global header) reads to offer project
                     selection, preserving each app's own active/last project
                     and permissions.

This is the SDK-side contract for the operator's 2026-09-10 ruling (no
project switcher in the global top header; project selection belongs on the
project/workspace surface). The selector UI + its styling live in scitex-ui /
the host surface — this module only DECLARES the scope and emits the marker
that tells that surface "this app is project-scoped". It does not fork any UI
primitive.

The marker is a sibling of the existing ``stx-mount`` meta (MOUNT_META_NAME):
same shape, same injection point, but it names a SCOPE, not a path.
