"""Compose a DECLARED ``(kind, action)`` access pair with ``scitex_dev.access``.

A leaf DECLARES the claim it makes on a resource kind (:class:`AccessClaim`); a
host COMPOSES it. This module is the composing half: it turns

    declared pair  +  principal  +  grants  +  memberships

into (a) the core's ``AccessFilter`` — the refs that principal may reach for that
kind and action, via the core's ``accessible()`` — and (b), for a LIST endpoint,
the Django ``Q`` that admits exactly those rows, via
:func:`scitex_sdk.app.access_django.to_q`. A list filtered by (b) therefore admits
exactly what the core's ``check()`` admits for one row, which is the property
that keeps a declared API surface and its access decision from drifting apart.

WHY THE PAIR AND NOT AN ACTION NAME (hub ruling, 2026-09-17, fixed). The claim is
an explicit ``(kind, action)`` pair because it is injective: ``view`` on a figure
and ``view`` on a dataset are different claims, and a single action name lets two
kinds collide into one declaration neither a reviewer nor the core can tell
apart. The single-name alternative is rejected, not merely unused.

FAIL CLOSED, LOUDLY, AND BY NAME — there is no default pair anywhere, because
every default would be a guess with access consequences: ``read``/public would
WIDEN the claim, and an empty filter would silently DROP rows.

* a blank or non-text member is refused (:class:`UnknownAccessPairError`): a pair
  whose half was never stated is not a pair;
* a kind the core does not register, or an action that kind's own spec does not
  declare, is refused with the pair AND what the core knows — the registered
  kinds, or the actions that kind declares. The pair is never resolved by
  guessing the nearest action;
* a missing core is a NAMED error (:class:`AccessCoreMissingError`), not a bare
  ``ImportError``: "the dependency is not installed" is a state the caller is
  told about, not a traceback to interpret.

EQUIVALENCE, NOT STRICTNESS. The refusals above are not a stricter rule than the
core's — they are the SAME rule, and the differential arms in
``tests/scitex_sdk/app/api_access/`` prove it in both directions: a pair this module
accepts is a pair the core accepts, and a pair it refuses is a pair the core
refuses. That is deliberate. A stricter rule is not extra safety: a rule the core
does not have drops declarations the core would have granted, which is exactly
the divergence class ``to_q``'s parent grammar was fixed for (hub verdict
2026-09-17 on PR #198).

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO, so a reader does not assume it. It does not carry
the pair INTO the merged declaration contract: ``scitex_sdk.app.api_plugin``'s
``AuthScope`` (five review rounds, merged as 78c6b28) still has no pair field, so
composing takes the pair as an explicit input rather than reading it off a route.
That keeps a reviewed public contract untouched, at the cost of leaving the
route↔pair BINDING to the caller; carrying the pair on ``AuthScope`` would close
that gap and is a public-surface decision recorded against the card
(``app-api-plugin-access-composition-20260917``) rather than taken here.

WHY THIS IS A SUBPACKAGE (``api_access/__init__.py``) AND NOT A ROOT MODULE:
``src/scitex_app`` sits at exactly PS-108b's flat-file threshold (15 counted
modules; the rule fires ABOVE 15), so a new root-level module would turn the
audit red for everyone — the collision the card
``app-package-root-at-ps108b-file-threshold-20260917`` predicts, dodged here
rather than fixed. The public name is unchanged (``scitex_sdk.app.api_access``); only
the on-disk shape differs, matching ``shell_contract`` and ``project_context``.

DEPENDENCY GATES, both optional at runtime. ``scitex_dev.access`` is imported
through an injectable importer (``importlib.import_module`` by default — a CALL,
not a static ``ImportFrom``, so it is invisible to the PS-140 symbol gate) and
only when a pair is composed; Django is imported only by :func:`compose_list_q`,
because ``scitex_sdk.app.access_django`` imports it. The module therefore imports,
and its filter-composition arms run, with NEITHER installed; only the
Django-backed arms need the ORM.
