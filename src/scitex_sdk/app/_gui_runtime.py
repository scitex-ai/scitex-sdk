"""Shared runtime state for scaffolded apps' standalone GUI launcher.

Generalizes scitex-writer's `gui serve/status/stop` runtime module
(scitex-writer PR #316) so every SciTeX app built on scitex_sdk.app.embed
gets the same safe launcher instead of re-copying it: bind the fixed
port or fail loud, refuse a second instance when a live pid is
recorded, self-heal stale state when the recorded pid is dead, and
identify a foreign port holder via /proc (no `ss`/`lsof` shell-out,
which are absent from minimal containers).

State lives at ``<scope>/.scitex/<package>/runtime/gui.json`` per the
fleet runtime-state-db layout (scitex-dev skill
``general/01_ecosystem/13_runtime-state-db-layout.md``), keyed by the
caller's own package name so multiple apps running locally do not
collide.

Pure state logic only -- no Click, no Django. Each consumer's CLI
layer owns argument parsing and process spawning.

    Ownership is proven from the ARGV, never from the process NAME: a
    ``comm`` of "python" names nothing, and every Python server on the
    box shares it -- killing on that basis would kill strangers. The
    argv, by contrast, carries the module or console-script that was
    actually run.

    ``argv[0]`` contributes only its last TWO path components -- the
    program and the directory immediately containing it. Distant ancestors
    are ignored. Everything after ``argv[0]`` is matched whole, so a module
    path still counts (see :func:`_normalize`).

    WHY argv[0] IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY (scitex-scholar, 2026-08-04):
    ``argv[0]`` is usually the INTERPRETER, not the thing that was run, and
    a project-local venv puts the project name high up in its path. Under
    the old whole-argv scan,
    ``/home/x/scitex-scholar/.venv/bin/python`` claimed EVERY process
    started from that venv as ours -- a pytest run, a jupyter kernel, an
    unrelated dev server. Measured on one box with only argv[0] differing:
    the venv path gave ``ours=True`` for a bare ``socket.bind`` + ``sleep``
    script with no relation to the GUI.

    That is not cosmetic, because :func:`terminate` fires on ``ours``: it
    made ``--force`` able to SIGTERM a stranger, which is the exact failure
    ``--force`` exists to avoid.

    WHY TWO COMPONENTS AND NOT JUST THE BASENAME: a package run by its own
    module path puts the evidence in the IMMEDIATE parent --
    ``.../site-packages/scitex_writer/__main__.py`` is genuinely ours, and
    basename alone (``__main__.py``) would throw that away. One level up is
    what the program IS; three levels up is only where it happens to live.
    Both real shapes therefore keep working:

        /opt/venv/.../scitex_writer/__main__.py   -> ours   (parent names it)
        /usr/local/bin/scitex-app-gui             -> ours   (script names it)
        /home/x/scitex-scholar/.venv/bin/python   -> NOT    (bin/python)
        /home/x/scitex-scholar/.venv/bin/jupyter  -> NOT    (bin/jupyter)

    KNOWN RESIDUAL, stated rather than implied: a stranger run as
    ``python /home/x/<package>/run.py`` still matches, because the token is
    in ``argv[1]`` and a script living inside the package tree is real argv
    evidence. Narrower than the interpreter case, and not closed here.
