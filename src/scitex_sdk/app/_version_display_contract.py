"""The shared leaf-application version-display contract.

Every leaf package shows its OWN installed version, continuously, and never a
hardcoded or hand-written manifest number. The version is read from
``importlib.metadata`` (the single source of truth); an editable checkout, a
stripped env, or a missing dist degrades to an explicit, LABELLED local
fallback rather than a crash or a fabricated release number.

This module is the source of truth for the accessor. The two other surfaces
build on it:
  - ``scitex_sdk.app.context_processors``  (the CONTINUOUS display — register once
    in TEMPLATES, the version renders on every page);
  - ``ScitexAppConfig.app_version``     (the per-app accessor, in ``_django.py``).

WHY importlib.metadata and not the manifest: a hand-written manifest ``version``
is FORBIDDEN by the validator (validator.py) because it drifts — 2026-07
incident: manifests pinned at 0.14.0 while the packages shipped 2.25.0 /
0.29.9 / 1.4.2, so every app tile showed a wrong version. Reading the installed
dist is the only source that is always true.
