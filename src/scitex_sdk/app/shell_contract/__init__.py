"""The mount-side app-shell contract: the props a leaf hands to the shell.

A leaf app (FigRecipe, Writer, Scholar, Stats, ...) does not own the header or
the navigation chrome — the presentation layer does (``scitex_ui``'s
``app-shell`` / ``standalone_shell``). What the leaf OWNS is the GENERIC
declaration of what belongs in that chrome:

  * **title**     the leaf's human name ("FigRecipe"), from its manifest label;
  * **version**   the leaf's INSTALLED package version — read through
                  ``ScitexAppConfig.app_version`` / ``package_version``, never a
                  hand-written manifest number (2026-07 incident: manifests
                  pinned at 0.14.0 while the packages shipped 2.25.0 / 0.29.9 /
                  1.4.2, so every tile showed a wrong version);
  * **project provider**  where the per-app project selector gets its projects
                  (URL + current + navigate target), or NOTHING for a
                  user-scoped app — see ``scitex_sdk.app._app_scope``: the global
                  header must never force a Project selector, and a user-scoped
                  app renders with no picker at all;
  * **actions**   header/command-bar entries, each pointing at a named command
                  or an href;
  * **named commands**  the command ids the leaf exposes, in the shape the
                  keymap registry already uses (``id -> {label, group,
                  sequence}``), so keyboard, touch and mouse reach the SAME
                  action by the same name.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT. It carries no app business logic and no markup: it
does not know what "Save recipe" does, only that the leaf exposes an action by
that label bound to that command id. Rendering, gesture handling, 44px targets,
cascading selectors and overlay insets live in the presentation layer; this is
the DATA half of that split, and the split is the point — the alternative
measured in the fleet was each leaf hand-rolling its own header and drifting.

WHY THE PROPS ARE EMITTED AS ONE JSON META TAG. A reader with no writer is not
half a feature; it is a feature that reaches nobody. ``scitex_ui``'s
``mount.ts`` shipped a reader before anything emitted its marker, and every
consumer got a ``MountPrefixMissingError`` (see ``scitex_sdk.ui.mount``). So this
module ships the WRITER together with the shape: :func:`shell_props_meta_tag`
renders ``<meta name="stx-app-shell" content="{...json...}">``, the same
injection point as ``stx-mount`` and ``stx-app-scope``, and the absence of that
tag is a meaningful state ("nobody declared shell props") rather than an empty
one to be guessed at.

FAIL LOUD, NEVER GUESS. Every field is validated at construction: a blank
title, a scope typo, a duplicate action/command id, an action with no
affordance at all, or a project provider on a user-scoped app all RAISE. Each
of those renders as a page that looks perfectly fine — which is exactly the
class of defect this contract exists to prevent, so degrading to a guessed
value is not an option.

ZERO THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES and no Django import at module scope: scitex-app's
base install is stdlib + click/rich/scitex-config, and the leaf-side surfaces
(CLI, MCP) must stay importable without Django.
