"""Leaf project context, using the SDK UI provider protocol.

The host supplies the projects an authenticated user may access. This module
returns explicit ok, none, denied and unavailable states, plus a display-safe
project descriptor and the stable scitex.project.change command.

An explicit project wins over last visited, then nothing is selected. A denied
explicit project never falls back; unavailable providers never invent a
