"""Django adapter for the ``scitex_dev.access`` primitive.

The core (``scitex_dev.access``) is backend-neutral: ``accessible()`` returns an
``AccessFilter`` — the set of owner / resource / parent refs a principal may
reach — and ``check()`` decides one resource. A backend turns that filter into
its own query so a LIST view admits exactly the rows ``check()`` would admit on
a single row. This module is the Django half of that contract.

The one rule, copied verbatim from ``scitex_dev.access._filter.AccessFilter``:

    a resource matches when
        (public and resource is public)
        or (grant_match(self) and (ceiling is None or grant_match(ceiling)))

    grant_match(f) = owner in f.owners
                     or ref in f.resources
                     or (parent is not None and parent in f.parents)

``to_q`` is the Q-translation of that rule. It is model-agnostic: it names the
four fields an ``AccessScopedModel`` must carry (``access_ref``,
``access_parent``, ``access_owner``, ``access_public``), and Django resolves
them against the concrete model at ``filter`` time. ``testing.assert_equivalent``
proves the translation against the core's own ``check()``.

FAIL-CLOSED (hub review item 1): a Django table is a separate store from the
core's in-memory ``Resource`` objects, so it can hold rows the core would
*reject at construction* — a ``kind:not-absolute`` ref, a ``..`` traversal, an
agent/anonymous/null owner, a public row with no owner. The adapter must not
adopt such a row as a grant. It therefore (a) validates on ``save`` (raising
:class:`InvalidAccessRowError`) and (b) ANDs a canonical-row conjunct into
``to_q`` (``access_ref`` present + owner present + parent either absent or
well-formed) so a row that slips past (a) is still EXCLUDED from every scoped
query, never admitted. The core's ``matches`` only ever sees well-formed rows,
so the conjunct is a no-op on valid data and a shield on bad data.

THE CONJUNCT IS "WHAT THE CORE ACCEPTS", PER FIELD, NOT ONE GRAMMAR FOR ALL
THREE (hub verdict 2026-09-17, PR #198 re-review at bbfbb9a). The core applies
DIFFERENT rules to the three dimensions, so a single strict grammar was itself
a divergence — measured: the core accepted rows whose parent was
``Doc:/parent``/``doc:/../parent``/``:/parent`` while the query rejected them,
i.e. a row the core GRANTED was silently dropped (check=True/query=False).
Each field therefore mirrors the core's OWN rule for that field:
``access_ref`` = canonical ``kind:/...`` with no ``..`` (the core's ``Resource``
path rule), ``access_owner`` = ``user:``/``org:`` with a valid segment (the
core's ``Principal``/``Resource`` owner rule), ``access_parent`` = the core's
``split_resource_ref`` shape only (see ``_PARENT_REF`` — kind case and ``..``
are NOT checked there, because the core does not check them). A diverging rule
is not "extra safety": in one direction it drops rows the core grants, in the
other it admits rows the core would reject, and both break the equivalence this
module exists to provide.

DEPENDENCY GATE (hub review items 2 + 4): the adapter imports
``scitex_dev.access`` ONLY inside ``AccessScopedManager.scoped`` — never at
module load — so this file imports cleanly in scitex-sdk app CI (which pins an
older scitex-dev) and only the conformance test skips. The import guard is
NARROW: a genuine absence of the submodule raises
:class:`ScitexDevAccessMissingError` (named, with the fix); an ``ImportError``
raised *inside* the core (a transitive/version failure) is re-raised, not
laundered into "missing".
