"""scitex_sdk.app.embed --- Public host-embedding API for SciTeX apps.

Wraps the Django integration base classes (``_django.py``) and the
standalone launcher (``_standalone.py``) behind one stable, public
import path, so host apps (figrecipe, writer, scitex-todo, storage, ...)
no longer need to reach into ``scitex_sdk.app._django`` / ``scitex_sdk.app._standalone``
directly.

Usage::

    from scitex_sdk.app.embed import run_standalone
    run_standalone(app_module="figrecipe._django", port=31298)

Or, mounting inside an existing Django project::

    from scitex_sdk.app.embed import ScitexAppConfig, scitex_urlpatterns

    Binds exactly `port`, or fails loud -- never silently drifts to
    the next free port. Refuses a second instance when a live pid is
    recorded (printing the running URL + pid), self-heals a stale
    recorded pid, and identifies a foreign port holder via /proc.

    `--force` (``force=True``) stops the instance recorded in our own
    runtime state AND reclaims an ORPHANED instance of our own -- one
    holding the port after dying without clearing its state file,

    exists for. It never touches a process it cannot prove is ours,

    Parameters
    ----------
    package : str
        Short package/CLI name (used for the runtime-state path and
        the printed remedy commands).
    project_dir : str
        Project directory recorded in the runtime state (informational).
    port, host : the address to bind.
    force : bool
        Stop a previous instance of OUR OWN server -- recorded or
        orphaned -- then serve.
    run_server : Callable[[], None]
        Zero-arg callable that BLOCKS running the actual dev server
        (e.g. ``functools.partial(run_standalone, app_module=..., port=port)``).
    state_path : optional
        Overrides the resolved runtime-state path -- real dependency
        injection for tests/callers with a custom scope.
