"""The answer to "may this actor do this?" — as a value, not a boolean.

TWO QUESTIONS, ONE VOCABULARY. `can()` answers for ONE resource ("may this
actor do this?") and `scope_for()` answers for a LIST ("which rows may this
actor see?"). Both return a value carrying the same five kinds — this module
ships the VERDICT those answers are expressed in, because scitex-ui is building
the display side against a shape agreed in conversation, and a contract that
lives only in a message thread drifts. Shipping the type makes their fixtures
real rather than a transcription of prose.

WHY A TAGGED VALUE RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN. Five things a caller must be able to
tell apart, and only one of them means "no, and nothing you do changes that":

    allowed                        yes
    denied                         no, and signing in would not help
    denied-because-not-signed-in   sign in, then ask again
    denied-because-not-entitled    signed in, lacks the entitlement THIS hub
                                   requires
    unresolved                     WE DO NOT KNOW. Resolution was attempted and
                                   failed. Not a denial, and must never be
                                   rendered as one.

A boolean collapses the last three into one, and the UI then has to reconstruct
which it was — from a message string, or from state it fetches separately. Two
places would know the reason, and they would disagree eventually. That is the
drift the single-home rule exists to prevent, so the reason travels WITH the
answer.

WHY THE PAYLOAD TRAVELS TOO. `denied-because-not-signed-in` without a sign-in
URL means the component hardcodes a route or the app passes it alongside — and
then two places know where sign-in lives. Same argument, one level down.

THE VERDICT CROSSES A PACKAGE BOUNDARY, so it is plain data. scitex-ui renders
it and MUST NOT depend on scitex-app: a UI package importing the state package
is the mirror of "the CLI and MCP surfaces must not pull scitex-ui", and
accepting one while breaking the other turns a boundary into a cycle. Hence
`to_dict()`, and hence nothing here needs scitex-sdk app installed to be understood.

NOT DECIDED HERE, deliberately: HOW entitlement is determined. scitex-sdk app stores
no plan, no tier, no price — it asks the hub's token API and reports the answer.
A paywall compiled into the SDK would put one deployment's commercial policy
into every self-hosted install.

    tier string their entitlement API returns — and never a token SCOPE. Their
    scopes (`*`, `api`, `mcp`, `publish`) say what a token may do on a user's
    behalf; entitlement is a property of the user's subscription, independent
    of which token they presented.

    which is availability information about a system the reader is not
    authenticated to. Deliberately not a `str` subclass, so that leak cannot
    happen by accident.

    WHAT THIS TYPE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: carry the resolved VALUE. A
    container pairing state with value (refusing RESOLVED-without-a-value, the
    way `Verdict` refuses a payload on the wrong kind) is the obvious next
    shape and was considered here. It is not built because nothing resolves

    WHY NOT DEFAULT TO THE HOSTED HUB. A default of `https://scitex.ai` makes
    "no hub" UNEXPRESSIBLE BY OMISSION: a self-hosted install that configures
    nothing would contact our service at its first authorization check, chosen
    by nobody. The two failure modes are not symmetric in DETECTABILITY, which
    is the argument that decided it:

        default no-hub, but a hub was wanted
            every hub-dependent action returns `denied`. The operator SEES the
            missing features and goes looking for configuration. Wrong, loud,
            self-correcting.

        default scitex.ai, but isolation was wanted
            it silently contacts us and everything WORKS. The only symptom is
            in a log the install's own operator cannot read. Invisible to
            exactly the person who would care.

    One failure announces itself to whoever can fix it; the other does not.

    AND THE STRUCTURAL REASON, which is this module's whole subject: a non-empty
    default COLLAPSES A THREE-VALUED STATE INTO TWO. "no hub configured", "hub
    configured but unreachable" and "hub configured and answering" must stay
    distinguishable — see `ResolveState` and the `denied` / `unresolved` split.
    Defaulting to a URL makes UNCONFIGURED indistinguishable from CONFIGURED, so
    the honest state stops being representable rather than merely being unusual.

    AN EMPTY OR BLANK VALUE READS AS NO HUB, not as a malformed URL. Setting the
    variable to "" is how an operator says "explicitly none" in a shell profile
    or a compose file where deleting the line is awkward, and treating that as a
    configuration error would punish the person who was being explicit.

    IDENTITY ON KIND, NOT A TRANSLATION TABLE. ``scitex_dev.access.DecisionKind``
    says so in its own words — \"The five answers; the strings match
    scitex_sdk.app.authz's Verdict kinds\" — and its members carry these strings
    verbatim, so the kind crosses BY VALUE. A table here would be a second place
    the five names live, and the next rename would have to be made in both.

    WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT JUST ``.value``: the two payload-bearing kinds
    cannot be built from the kind alone. `Verdict` REFUSES a not-signed-in
    verdict with no route and a not-entitled verdict with no identifier — its
    validator enforces BOTH directions — so the payload must be supplied by
    whoever knows it. That is the HUB, not this module: a sign-in route or an
    upgrade URL compiled in here would put ONE deployment's routes into every
    self-hosted install, which is the argument `denied_not_entitled` already
    makes for `upgrade_url`. The payload is passed through untouched, so an
    absent one fails LOUD in the validator that owns the rule instead of being
    invented here.

    A payload the deciding kind does NOT carry is FORWARDED NOWHERE — it is not
    attached to the verdict, so the page-facing rule (`Verdict`: a route on a
    denial that is not about signing in tells the user to do something that
    cannot help) still holds, and the natural call site stays legal: a render
    path that has its deployment's routes in hand can pass them on EVERY call
    without first knowing which kind it will get back. Deliberately not an
    error, because such a caller is doing the right thing; deliberately not
    threaded through either, because the verdict is what reaches the page.

    TOTAL over the core's kinds, and a kind the core grows and this module does
    not know lands in `Verdict`'s own unknown-kind refusal — loud AT the
    boundary, which is where a sixth kind has to become a conversation with
    scitex-ui rather than a silent branch (see `VERDICT_KINDS`).

    The one question every app asks instead of hand-rolling a gate. The decision
    RULES are not reimplemented here: they are the core's
    (``scitex_dev.access.check`` — owner / grant / inherited / org / public, the
    agent ceiling, no staff bypass), and this function's job is to (a) enforce
    the resolve-before-render contract and (b) express the answer in the ONE
    vocabulary scitex-ui already renders.

    ARGUMENTS, and why each is not a convenience:

        actor, action, resource
            The core's ``Principal`` / ``str`` / ``Resource``. Typed ``Any``
            because ``scitex_dev.access`` is an OPTIONAL runtime dependency
            imported through a call (invisible to the PS-140 static gate), so
            naming its types here would import the core at module load — the
            thing `access_django` deliberately avoids.

        state
            `ResolveState`, and the reason this signature has a keyword that a
            boolean would have hidden. NOT_ATTEMPTED RAISES (a caller who never
            resolved has violated the contract), FAILED RETURNS `unresolved()`
            (a real operating state the screen must still draw), RESOLVED
            decides. Held as \"a value, or None\" the first two are one state and
            this function cannot choose — the tripwire in this module's tests
            was written before this function existed, to guard exactly that.

        grants, memberships
            What the caller resolved. Passed through to ``check()`` unchanged.
            An entitlement enforcer that needs to attach an external decision
            should call :func:`verdict_from_decision` instead.

        sign_in_url, entitlement, upgrade_url
            The payloads for the two kinds that carry one — supplied BY THE
            DEPLOYMENT, never derived here (see :func:`verdict_from_decision`).
            A deployment's render path can pass them on EVERY call, because a
            payload the returned kind does not carry is simply not attached; you
            do not have to know the verdict in advance to supply them. Omitting
            one that the returned kind DOES require fails loud, out of
            `Verdict`'s validator, which is the one place that rule lives.

    FAILS CLOSED AND LOUD on a missing core (:class:`AccessPrimitiveMissingError`)
    rather than returning `denied`: an install that cannot decide and an install
    that decided \"no\" are different situations, and only one of them is fixed by

# parent / public, plus the agent ceiling — and ADR 0002 §2 names that value
# "the data-scope half". So what was missing was never the RULE; it was an
# ANSWER AN APP CAN HOLD. A bare filter cannot say "we could not find out who is
# asking", and a list rendered from the empty filter TELLS A SIGNED-IN PERSON
# THEY HAVE NO CONTENT when the truth is that nobody checked — the same collapse
# `Verdict` exists to prevent, one row-set down. The filter therefore travels
# WITH the verdict kind that produced it (:class:`DataScope`).
#
# NOT `_app_scope`, AND THE NEAR-MISS IS WHY THE NAME DIFFERS. `scitex_sdk.app.
# _app_scope` declares a manifest's RENDERING scope (SCOPE_USER / SCOPE_PROJECT:
# does this app get a project selector) — a fact about a PAGE. This is a fact
# about ROWS. Two different things answering to "scope" is how a reader
# concludes one of them does not exist, so the value is named with the ADR's own
# phrase for this half instead of sharing the word.
#
# "OWN / ORG / OPERATOR" IS DERIVED, NOT A FOURTH VOCABULARY. The ask that
# produced this function enumerated three scopes; the approved design superseded
# that enumeration. A principal is `user:` / `org:` / `agent:` / `anonymous` —
# `scitex_dev.scope`'s vocabulary, not a parallel one — "own" is an owner match,
# "org" arrives through a :class:`Membership`, and an operator is an ordinary
# `org:` grant rather than a fourth kind of person ("treat everyone the same, me
# or a customer"). All three therefore fall OUT of the filter, and an enum here
# would be exactly the second vocabulary the operator ruled out.

    Two fields, and the second exists because of the first. ``kind`` is one of

    so a scoped-empty list renders through the switch a denied detail page
    renders through — the operator's "route scoped empties through the verdict,
    not through HTTP status"); ``access_filter`` is the core's ``AccessFilter``
    and is present on ``allowed`` and on NOTHING ELSE.

    WHY THE FILTER IS WITHHELD RATHER THAN EMPTIED on the other four kinds. An
    empty filter is a claim — "there are no rows for you" — and every non-allowed
    kind is a case where we are not entitled to make it: a denial is a decision
    about an action, ``unresolved`` is the absence of a decision, and rendering
    either as "no content" invents an answer. So an app cannot accidentally
    query with a scope that did not earn one; it has to read ``kind`` and render
    the state, which is the work the five kinds exist to force.

    ``access_filter`` is the core's object, passed through untouched, so both
    documented downstreams work unchanged: ``scitex_dev.access.select(scope.
    access_filter, resources)`` in memory, and ``scitex_sdk.app.access_django.
    to_q(scope.access_filter)`` for a queryset. This type adds no query
    grammar of its own — a translation invented here would be a second place
    the row rule lives.

    THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO ``.allowed`` BOOLEAN PROPERTY, for the reason
    :class:`Verdict` gives, and it would be worse here: ``if scope.allowed:``
    reads naturally and makes "we could not decide" indistinguishable from
    "nothing for you", which is the exact confusion this pairing removes.

    AND NO ``to_dict()``. :class:`Verdict` has one because it crosses a package
    boundary into scitex-ui, which has no access to the core. A scope does not
    cross anything: the filter is meaningless to a renderer, and the part that
    does cross — ``kind`` — is already a plain string. Serialising a filter
    would invent a wire format no consumer asked for.
