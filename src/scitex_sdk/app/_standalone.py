    figrecipe each carried a verbatim copy of this function, and on the 0.10.1
    release both were replacing their copy with
    ``from scitex_sdk.app._standalone import _hosts_to_allow`` — three repositories
    committing to an underscore path, which is a promise nobody made. Deciding
    the public name before the dependency exists is cheaper than deprecating an
    accidental one afterwards.

    That private alias is GONE as of 2026-09-04. It existed only for the
    migration window and was removed once both consumers had swapped, measured
    against their refs rather than their working trees. Import the public name.

    Host header is the real interface address, and "0.0.0.0" in ALLOWED_HOSTS
    never matches that. Measured 2026-09-02 on the published 1.9.0 wheel:

    `extra_hosts` is a comma-separated string contributing additional names, for
    the proxy/tunnel case where the reachable name is not the bound address. The
    caller reads `SCITEX_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and passes it in: keeping the env read
    OUT of this function makes it pure, so its tests need no fixture that
    reaches into process state. PA-306 forbids mocks, and the first draft of
    these tests used `monkeypatch` precisely because the function was impure —
    the rule was pointing at the design, not at the test.

    Deliberately NOT widened to `["*"]` under DEBUG. That is what the leaves are
    doing, and it is defensible there, but these apps ship no authentication —
    `"*"` plus no auth makes every reachable address an unauthenticated reader,
