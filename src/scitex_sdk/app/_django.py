    Root is ``""``; embedded is e.g. ``"/apps/u/figrecipe"``. Client code
    joins as ``prefix + "/api/x"`` — the slash belongs to the ENDPOINT.

    WHY THE SLASH SITS ON THE ENDPOINT, measured rather than chosen. The
    opposite convention (prefix ends in "/", endpoint does not start with
    one) shipped in 0.7.0-0.7.1 and was withdrawn because its most likely
    misuse leaves the origin::

        "/" + "/api/x"  ->  //api/x  ->  https://api/x     A DIFFERENT HOST

    ``//api/x`` is protocol-relative, so a leading slash on the endpoint —
    the natural instinct — sends the request, and whatever it carries, off
    site. This convention's corresponding misuse (endpoint missing its
    slash) yields ``/apps/u/fapi/x``: a 404 on the right host. Both were
    run through a real URL resolver; only the failure cases distinguish
    them, which is why picking on taste got it wrong.

    WHY `view_path` IS REQUIRED FOR NON-ROOT VIEWS. ``request.path`` is the
    WHOLE path — the mount prefix AND whatever route the view occupies
    inside the app. Subtracting the view's own route is the only way to
    recover the prefix, and only the view knows that route, because the
    view is what wrote it in ``urls.py``. A derivation that skips this is
    silently correct at the app root and silently WRONG everywhere else;
    0.7.1 shipped exactly that and this is the correction.

    ``request.path``, never ``request.path_info``: ``path_info`` has
    SCRIPT_NAME stripped, which is the prefix we are trying to read. And
    never add SCRIPT_NAME back on — ``request.path`` already contains it
    (django/core/handlers/wsgi.py), so doing so DOUBLES the prefix under
    the very convention it looks like it is guarding against.

    Contract, implementation and both traps above converged with
    scitex-ui, whose `scitex_sdk.ui.mount` reasoned them out first.
