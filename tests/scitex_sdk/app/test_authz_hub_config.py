"""Hub configuration: the default is the decision.

Operator ruling 2026-09-06, via scitex-hub:
「ハブなしを規定にしてもらってで、うるさく失敗するヒントは出すでいいと思います」
— make no-hub the default, and fail noisily with hints.

These tests exist because a DEFAULT is the easiest thing in a codebase to
change by accident and the hardest to notice: nothing fails when it flips, the
suite stays green, and an install that was contacting nobody starts contacting
somebody. The assertion that `hub_url({})` is None is the whole ruling.
