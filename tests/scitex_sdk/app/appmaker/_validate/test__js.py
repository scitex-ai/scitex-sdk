    The object is imported by scitex_sdk.app.validator, so with a list any importer

    scitex-writer 2026-09-06 as the one part of their answer that is a live bug
    rather than a preference.

    THIS ASSERTS THE DECLARATION, NOT THE HAZARD, and those are two claims.
    `type(x) is tuple` says how the object was written; it does not say a caller
    cannot mutate it. In CPython they coincide, but coinciding is not being the
    same claim — see the two tests below, which assert the one anybody actually
    cares about. This one is kept because it fails at the DECLARATION, which is
    the earlier and more legible place.

    (An earlier version of this docstring argued that the type check was
    PREFERABLE to catching AttributeError "because a caller that reaches for
    .append() on a tuple is already a bug the reader should see". That is an
    argument about which failure is legible to a maintainer, and I presented it
    as if it settled whether the hazard was closed. scitex-writer measured the
    difference and was right.)
