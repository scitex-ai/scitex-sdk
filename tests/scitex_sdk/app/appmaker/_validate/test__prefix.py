    fails, the rule has silently started failing three peer repos' builds for
    work two of them have not begun." That sentence did its job — it made
    arming a deliberate edit rather than something that happened.

    The condition it was protecting is now MET, by measurement rather than by
    elapsed time:

        writer / figrecipe / scholar   0 findings on their current refs,

                                       positive control returned exactly 1

    hub gave the go-ahead 2026-09-05T20:16Z, ahead of the 09-07 they committed
    to, and their standing instruction had been to come back BEFORE arming.

    WHAT ARMING MEANS FOR A CONSUMER, measured by hub in their own tree: four
    call sites take the new default, and the one that matters is their
    PUBLICATION GATE. From today, a submitted app carrying a root-absolute
    request URL cannot be published. That is the intent of the rule — such an
    app 404s under any mount — and it is a user-visible behaviour change, so it
    is announced rather than merely shipped.

    PREFIX_SKIP_DIRS so a scan of a REPO ROOT does not descend into sibling

    MY FIRST FIX ALSO REFUSED such a root, as belt-and-braces. hub pointed out

    `<repo>/.worktrees/<name>/`, so scanning a worktree is their NORMAL path.
