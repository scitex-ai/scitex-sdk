"""The declared ``(kind, action)`` pair, composed with ``scitex_dev.access``.

``scitex_sdk.app.api_access`` turns a DECLARED pair plus a principal into the core's
``AccessFilter`` and, for a list endpoint, into the Django ``Q`` that admits
exactly the rows the core's ``check()`` allows. This suite proves that, and it
proves it as EQUIVALENCE with the core rather than as agreement with a
hand-written expectation:

  * the PAIR VERDICT agrees with the core in both directions — a pair this module
    accepts is a pair the core accepts, and a pair it refuses is a pair the core
    refuses (so the refusals are not a stricter rule that would drop what the
    core grants, the divergence class fixed on PR #198);
  * the COMPOSED FILTER is field-identical to ``accessible()``'s, across the
    core's own random fixtures and every principal they mention;
  * the COMPOSED Q admits exactly ``check()``'s refs, over a real SQLite table.

DEPENDENCY GATE, exactly as ``test_access_django.py``: the core is optional, so
the differential arms call ``pytest.skip`` with a named reason when
``scitex_dev.access`` is absent (scitex-app's pinned CI). ``api_access`` itself
imports cleanly without the core and without Django — only ``compose_list_q``
needs the ORM — so collection never fails there. Under
``SCITEX_ACCESS_STRICT=1`` (the ci.yml conformance job) a skip is a failure, so
this suite cannot pass by not running against the core.

AAA markers on their own lines (STX-TQ002); one assertion per test (STX-TQ007).

# here would leak into a sibling suite that asserts "this process really has no
# database" — a true precondition about the process it runs in, not a
# disagreement about this module. The Q-backed arms are therefore the POINT of
# the isolated conformance step, which sets SCITEX_ACCESS_STRICT=1 (the same flag
# that turns any skip into a failure); everywhere else this module configures the
# same empty DATABASES as its siblings and those arms skip with the reason the
# `_db` fixture gives. The blocks must agree, because the module order in a
