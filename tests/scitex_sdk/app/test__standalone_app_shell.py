"""`app_shell.html` ships in the wheel and its block contract renders.

The adapter (scitex-app's) delegates to scitex-ui's `standalone_shell.html`
and re-opens that shell's `app_content` block as `scitex_app_content`. The
shell also exposes `extra_css` (head) and `extra_js` (tail) — measured on
scitex-ui develop `standalone_shell.html` lines 57/495/511 — and those pass
straight through the adapter to leaf apps, which is the contract Cards'
board_v3/standalone migration and SAC's fleet.html depend on.

The template search root is resolved RELATIVE TO THE IMPORTED `scitex_app`
package, so this test asserts the shipped artifact (the installed build in
CI), not a checkout path. The scitex-ui side is a hermetic stub with the
real shell's block names: scitex-app's own CI deliberately runs without
scitex-ui (that is the case `ScitexUiRequiredError` names), and the stub
keeps this contract test green there without weakening it.
