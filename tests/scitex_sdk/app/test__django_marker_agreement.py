"""The `stx-mount` marker name must agree across packages AND across languages.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. The name is a contract: the server emits
`<meta name="stx-mount">` and the client reads it. Both halves hardcode the
string, and they live in different packages and different languages:

    scitex_sdk/app/_django.py            MOUNT_META_NAME = "stx-mount"   RENDERS it
    scitex_sdk/app/embed.py              MOUNT_META_NAME = "stx-mount"   fallback
    scitex_sdk/ui/mount.py               MOUNT_META_NAME = "stx-mount"
    scitex_ui .../ts/_base/mount.ts  export const MOUNT_META_NAME    READS it

Four declarations, one decision, and until this file nothing enforced that they
agree. scitex_ui's own comment says "Must match ``MOUNT_META_NAME`` in
mount.ts" — the honest version, naming the coupling while admitting there is no
mechanism.

WHY A COMMENT IS NOT ENOUGH, concretely. Rename the constant on one side only
and the failure is silent and asymmetric. Server emits the new name, client
reads the old: `querySelector` returns null and the prescribed client code
throws, which is at least loud. The other ordering degrades to a page that
renders perfectly and whose API calls 404 only when mounted under a prefix —
the quiet failure this whole contract exists to prevent.

WHY IT IS SAFE TO READ scitex_ui HERE. scitex-app does NOT depend on scitex-ui
and must not: scitex-ui is the presentation layer, and this SDK's CLI and MCP
surfaces are required to stay headless. These tests SKIP when scitex-ui is
absent, so the dependency is one-way and optional. They run in the CI job that
installs scitex-ui for the reference example -- which was FALSE when this
sentence was first written, and is true only as of 2026-09-03. That job ran
the example's own tests and never this file, so every cross-package arm here
SKIPPED in CI from the day it landed: measured `.ss......` on PR #121, a week
later. The workflow now runs them explicitly. The sentence was written from
the INTENT rather than from the workflow, which is the mistake not to repeat.

WHAT THAT COSTS, said plainly: that job is deliberately NOT a required context,
so this is a RECORD rather than a gate — visible on a pull request, blocking
nothing. Promoting it is tracked on
app-arm-the-example-leg-once-it-has-a-track-record. A skipped test and a passing
test look identical in a summary line, which is exactly why the skip reason
below names what was not checked.

THE GENERAL PROBLEM, of which this is instance one: a constant shared between
scitex-app's Python and scitex-ui's TypeScript, with nothing connecting them.
Instance two is the authorization verdict's `kind` strings, which scitex-ui
mirrors as a TypeScript union. Same shape, same fix — this file is the worked
example that one follows.
