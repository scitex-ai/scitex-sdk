"""Standalone i18n: activation, and saying so when a catalog is missing.

Measured 2026-08-23: catalog DISCOVERY was already free (Django auto-discovers
`<app>/locale/`), but nothing ever called activate(), so a standalone app shipped
a working Japanese catalog and rendered English forever. scitex-hub found the
mirror image in their stack — activation wired, catalog empty. Both fall back
silently to the source string.

No fixtures reach into process state: every helper takes its inputs as
arguments, so the tests need no environment patching (PA-306 forbids mocks).

One assertion each.
