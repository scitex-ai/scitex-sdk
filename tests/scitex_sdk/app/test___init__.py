"""`import scitex_app` must not drag a web framework in with it.

Mirrors src/scitex_sdk/app/__init__.py: the eager re-export that makes this property
fragile lives there, so the constraint is tested against the module that carries
it. (Named test__import_purity.py first; the project-structure audit rejected it
as an orphan test with no matching source file, and the rule was right — the
better name was the one that says which module the property belongs to.)

WHY THIS EXISTS. 0.11.0 added `from ._standalone import hosts_to_allow` to the
package root, so `_standalone` — the module that runs Django servers — now
imports EAGERLY on every `import scitex_app`. It keeps its Django imports inside
its functions, so the property holds; nothing enforced that it kept holding.

WHY IT MATTERS TO SOMEONE ELSE. scitex-scholar made scitex-app a HARD dependency
of their server extra and retired the "scitex-app not installed" fallback, on
the correct reasoning that a fallback which still starts but silently drops the
ALLOWED_HOSTS derivation is worse than a loud failure. That trade is only sound
while importing this package is cheap and side-effect-free: an import-time
regression here is now an OUTAGE there, not a downgrade.

WHY THE EXISTING GATE DOES NOT COVER IT. The import-smoke CI leg installs the
extras, so Django is present in that environment and the leg passes whether or
not the property holds. A gate that cannot fail for the case that matters is not
a gate — hence a subprocess, which makes the assertion independent of what
happens to be installed in the runner.
