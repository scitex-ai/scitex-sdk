"""Tests for scitex_sdk.app._django — the mount-prefix marker.

The marker is what lets ONE codebase serve both standalone and as a
scitex-hub built-in app. `scitex_urlpatterns` is already prefix-agnostic
server-side, but nothing told the BROWSER where the app was mounted, so
client code hardcoded "/" — correct standalone, silently broken embedded.
