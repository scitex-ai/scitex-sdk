"""Tests for scitex_sdk/app/authz.py — the verdict type, and can() that returns it.

One assertion each. Every rule here is a promise made to scitex-ui before they
wrote their display component, so each arm names the promise it holds.

THE ARMS SPLIT IN TWO, deliberately, and the split is by what they need:

  * contract arms — can()'s resolve-before-render behaviour and the
    absent-dependency predicate. These need NO core (`importer` is a seam), so
    they are unconditional and can never skip.
  * decision arms — the core's decision becoming this package's Verdict. These
    need scitex_dev.access and are guarded by `_core`; under
    SCITEX_ACCESS_STRICT=1 tests/scitex_sdk/app/conftest.py upgrades that guard to a
    FAILURE, which is what makes it a proof rather than a silent skip.

# about code that does not exist yet, and it is written to FAIL the moment that
# code appears — which is the only moment the decision can be violated.
#
# THE DECISION. `can()` must distinguish two causes of "unresolved":
#
#     A. the caller never resolved        -> RAISE (a contract violation;
#                                            returning a verdict renders a BUG
#                                            as a legitimate "not yet known" UI)
#     B. resolution attempted and FAILED  -> return an `unresolved` verdict
#        (hub unreachable, timeout, 5xx)     (a real operating state; the screen
#                                            must still draw something)
#
# THAT IS ONLY IMPLEMENTABLE IF THE RESOLVE RESULT IS THREE-VALUED:
#
#     NOT_ATTEMPTED | FAILED | RESOLVED
#
# Held as "a value, or None" it is TWO-valued, A and B become the same state,
# and the decomposition silently becomes unimplementable. That is the same
# three-value collapse this repo hit three times in one week (pass/fail/skip;
# DIVERGED/AGREE/CANNOT-TELL) — recorded here BEFORE the code rather than found
# in it afterwards.
#
# WHY A TRIPWIRE AND NOT A COMMENT. scitex-ui's objection to the card note, and
# it is correct: a constraint written in prose fails NOTHING when someone writes
# the resolver two-valued. It passes review, the suite is green, and nobody is
# told the decomposition just died. That is §2's declaration-that-evaporates,
# one step before it becomes a gate that cannot fail.
#
# IT ASSERTS THE SHAPE, NOT THE ABSENCE — rewritten 2026-09-04 on scitex-ui's
# argument, which is better than the version I shipped hours earlier.
#
# The first draft asserted that NO resolver exists, so it went red the moment
# someone added one. That punishes CORRECT work: the person who implements the
# resolver properly is the first casualty, and the red means "progress" rather
# than "defect". Repeated, that teaches a reader that red is something to push
# past — the same harm as a permanently-red retired workflow.
#
# This version is silent while the resolver is absent and substantive the moment
# it appears. Red here always means the same thing: the three-valued constraint
# was violated. So it never fires on correct work, and its meaning is constant.
#
# A conditional guard that is vacuous today is exactly the gate-that-cannot-fail
# this file is about — which is why it is CALIBRATED in the commit that
# introduced it: a two-valued resolver makes it red, a three-valued one keeps it
# green, both observed rather than reasoned.
