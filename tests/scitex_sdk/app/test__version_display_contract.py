"""The shared leaf-app version-display contract.

Every leaf package shows its OWN installed version, continuously, and never a
hardcoded or hand-written manifest number. The version is read from
importlib.metadata (the single source of truth) with an explicit, labelled
development fallback. This is the contract a leaf app (or the host chrome)
consumes; the per-app adoption lives in the consumers' own repos.

WHAT IT PINS (the 2026-07 incident this exists to prevent): manifests were
pinned at 0.14.0 while the packages shipped 2.25.0 / 0.29.9 / 1.4.2, so every
app tile showed a WRONG version. ``ScitexAppConfig.app_version`` used to read
``manifest["version"]`` — the forbidden, drifting source. It must read the
installed dist instead.

One assertion per test (STX-TQ007); AAA markers on their own lines (STX-TQ002).
No mocks (PA-306): the fallback is exercised against a package that genuinely
does not exist, and app_version against a real temp app module + manifest.
