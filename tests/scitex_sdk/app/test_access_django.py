"""`to_q` admits exactly the rows the core's `check()` allows.

The conformance proof the ADR commits to: a Django ``Q`` translation of
``AccessFilter`` is only as good as its agreement with ``check()`` on a single
row. ``scitex_dev.access.testing.assert_equivalent`` runs the core's own
``check()`` over every (principal, action, resource) in a battery of random
fixtures and demands the selector return exactly the allowed refs. Here the
selector is a real in-memory SQLite queryset filtered by
``_ScopedRow.objects.scoped(...)`` — i.e. the actual ``to_q``.

DEPENDENCY GATE: importing ``scitex_dev.access.testing`` is guarded. In
scitex-app's own CI (which pins an older scitex-dev) the proof cannot run and
is skipped with a named reason; ``access_django`` itself imports cleanly
(it does not touch ``scitex_dev`` at module load, only inside
``AccessScopedManager.scoped``), so this test's collection never fails there.
When the access release lands, the proof runs and is the merge gate.

# WHY THE REAL DATABASE IS CONFIGURED ONLY FOR THE STRICT PROOF RUN.
#
# Django settings are PROCESS-GLOBAL, and pytest imports every module it will
# run into one process — under CI's `-n auto`, one process per xdist worker. A
# real `DATABASES["default"]` configured here therefore leaks into whatever else
# that worker runs. Measured on PR #198 (commit b1b253a): five
# tests/scitex_sdk/app/_chat cases assert "this process really has no database" and
# failed in the workers that also received this module; reproduced
# deterministically (no xdist needed) with
#
#     pytest tests/scitex_sdk/app/test_access_django.py \
#            tests/scitex_sdk/app/_chat/test__django_db_free.py ...   -> 5 failed
#
# Neither module is wrong: the _chat suite states a TRUE precondition about the
# process it runs in, and this module needs a real DB to prove its translation.
# So the DB is configured only where it is the POINT of the run — the isolated
# conformance step, which sets SCITEX_ACCESS_STRICT=1 (the same flag that turns
# any skip into a failure). Everywhere else this module configures the same
# empty DATABASES as its siblings, and its DB-backed cases skip with the reason
# the `_db` fixture gives. The strict step runs this module ALONE, so nothing
# else in that process can be affected.
