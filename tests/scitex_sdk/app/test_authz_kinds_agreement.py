"""The authorization verdict's `kind` strings must agree across packages AND
across languages.

INSTANCE TWO of the problem `test__django_marker_agreement.py` names at the end
of its own docstring, and that file is the worked example this one follows.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. `scitex_sdk.app.authz` PRODUCES the verdict; scitex-ui RENDERS it.
The value crosses the boundary as plain serialisable data, so scitex-ui does not
and must not import scitex-app — an app depends on both, and importing the SDK
from the presentation layer would point that arrow backwards. The cost of that
correct boundary is that the five strings are declared twice, in two languages,
in two repositories:

    scitex_sdk/app/authz.py                   ALLOWED = "allowed"           BUILDS
    scitex_ui .../ts/app/dim/types.ts     export const ALLOWED = ...    RENDERS

scitex-ui's own file said it plainly: "THE FOUR KIND STRINGS BELOW ARE A SECOND
COPY of scitex_sdk.app.authz's, in another repo, and nothing in this file can detect
a rename on their side."

THAT SENTENCE IS GONE FROM THEIR FILE AS OF 0.20.2, and how it went is the
point. Adding the fifth kind would have shipped a comment saying FOUR on the
very file this check reads — a stale comment DENYING the count beside the code
that sets it. They caught it only because a control they ran for an unrelated
reason made them open the real file. Quoted here as history, and kept rather
than deleted because the near-miss is the useful part.

WHY THE CHECK LIVES HERE AND NOT THERE. The breakage would appear in scitex-ui,
but the cause is a rename in scitex-app. A check nearest the rename PREVENTS;
a check at the far end DETECTS, after someone has already shipped. This one runs
where the edit happens.

HOW A DIVERGENCE FAILS, concretely, since "the strings differ" understates it.
A renamed kind arrives at the TypeScript switch as an unhandled value. scitex-ui
has an `assertNever` there, so a fifth or renamed kind is a compile error rather
than a silent branch — good, and it means the failure lands at THEIR build, from
OUR edit, with nothing in between to say why. That is the loop this closes.

WHAT THIS COSTS, said plainly, in the same terms as its sibling: it runs in the
CI job that installs scitex-ui for the reference example, and that job is
deliberately NOT a required context. That job had to be TAUGHT to run this
file -- it previously ran only the example's own tests, so the sibling check
skipped in CI for a week while its docstring claimed otherwise. So this is a RECORD, not a gate — visible
on a pull request, blocking nothing. Promoting it is tracked on
app-arm-the-example-leg-once-it-has-a-track-record. Saying so because a skipped
test and a passing test look identical in a summary line.

CALIBRATION — DONE, AND RECORDED AS HISTORY RATHER THAN DELETED.
When this file landed, `dim/types.ts` was merged in scitex-ui but shipped in NO
RELEASE (installed scitex-ui was 0.19.1), so the check hit its own FILE-MISSING
arm and FAILED. That red was not a defect to work around; it was the one
observation proving the check can fail for the reason it claims to. It ran in
this order, all four steps observed:

    1. this check lands on a branch
    2. RED is observed here            <- calibration
    3. scitex-ui releases
    4. re-run -> green -> merge

THE FIFTH KIND WENT THE SAME WAY, and the ORDER IS THE LESSON. This check reads
the INSTALLED scitex-ui, so:

    TS first (their wheel ships UNRESOLVED, then Python)   this side went SILENT
    Python first                                           RED, and this side
                                                           CANNOT clear it —
                                                           it waits on someone
                                                           else's release

THAT SILENCE WAS A HOLE, AND IT IS NOW CLOSED. `_read_ts_kinds` used to filter
the far side to names Python already declares, so an ADDITION over there was
invisible here — measured on the shipped 0.20.2 wheel, TS 5 against Python 4
compared EQUAL. The whole fifth-kind rollout ran through that window watched by
hand rather than by this file.

It now reads the `VerdictKind` UNION instead, which is where TypeScript itself
says what the set is, and both directions are calibrated:

    TS 5 vs Python 4   DETECTED   (was MISSED)
    TS 5 vs Python 5   agrees     (the control, without which "not equal"
                                   proves nothing)

TS-first remains the right ORDER — a red nobody can clear is worse than one you
can — but the reason is now only sequencing, not a gap somebody must remember to
watch.

Their words, and the reason the order is theirs to keep rather than mine to
waive: "あなたの較正はあなたのものなので、私からは提案しません."
