"""ALLOWED_HOSTS must include the address the server was told to bind.

Reported by scitex-scholar 2026-08-23: `serve --host <addr>` started cleanly,
printed "serving at http://<addr>:<port>", and then answered 400 to every
caller. The startup banner asserted the opposite of the truth, which is why the
first minutes went into looking at the network.

No fixtures reach into process state: `_allowed_hosts` takes the extra-hosts
string as an argument and the caller reads the env. The first draft used
`monkeypatch` and PA-306 rejected it — correctly, because needing to patch the
environment was a symptom of the function being impure, not of the rule being
strict.

One assertion each — these are rows of a truth table, and a compound assert
would report "the table is wrong" instead of naming the row.
